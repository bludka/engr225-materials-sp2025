This class will have group work and will provide you opportunities to reflect on how well you and your group members are working together as professionals. I expect you to contribute to our class active learning environment in a professional and productive manner. The American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) has a Canons of the ASCE Code of Ethics for peers (and for Clients and Employers as well). These canons provide you the standard you will be held accountable to as a professional. Learning to behave in a professional manner takes practice and reflection. Learning this skill is critically important for your career. Students who are behaving professional do the following:\n",
    "    * Show up, on time, and participate\n",
    "    * Speak and listen respectfully\n",
    "    * Treat classmates and colleagues with respect and kindness\n",
    "    * Take responsibility for shortcomings, errors, mistakes, etc., and recognize them as opportunities to improve\n",
    "    * Practice inclusive behavior that invites and empowers people with diverse viewpoints and backgrounds to fully engage and thrive in team and individual work\n",
    "* Students in this class are encouraged to speak up and participate in-class. Each of us must show respect for each other because our class represents a diversity of beliefs, backgrounds, and experiences. When we show respect for each other, we can be more enriched by our experiences together. In this class, people of all ethnicities, gender identities, religions, ages, sexual orientations, disabilities, socioeconomic backgrounds, regions, and nationalities are strongly encouraged to share their rich array of perspectives and experiences. If you feel your differences may in some way isolate you from our classroom community or if you have a specific need, please speak with me early in the semester so that I can work together to help you become an active and engaged member of our class and community.\n",
    "* In addition, professional behavior does not disrupt the learning environment. Cal Poly Humboldt Campus Policies and Procedures defines disruptive behavior as “persistent questioning, incoherent comments, verbal attacks, unrecognized speaking out, incessant arguing, intimidating shouting, and inappropriate gestures;” this includes dominating or not participating in conversation, interrupting peers/professor, and/or being rude and impatient towards others. Such disruptive behaviors will not be tolerated."
